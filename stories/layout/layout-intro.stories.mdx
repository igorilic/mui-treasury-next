# Layout V5

Built for `material-ui v5`. This library exposes a group of enhanced Material-UI components to build modern-web layout instantly.

### What's new

We leverage high quality components from [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com) and great interface
library from [React](https://reactjs.org/) to let you turn your idea into product.
From dashboard, to blog, to social webapp until mailbox layout. This library has proved to be compatible
with these convoluted layout.

A little bit from v3.
We had lessons learn from previous version (v3.3.4) that it has a lot of spaces to be improved.
These are major points that we try to achieve in v4.

- Reduce JS calculation and leverage css-in-js for server side rendering (no more blip at first paint)
- Keep the library lean as much as possible. Get rid of lodash and don't rely on specific css-in-js lib (jss is still used internally in Material-UI, so we cannot remove it)
- Improve developer experience by rewriting with typescript and design new API
- Add more documentation & troubleshoot requested from developers (thanks everyone)
- Reduce bundle size and make it tree shakeable!
- `>=v4.4.0`, support built-in RTL from material-ui

  The whole bundle size at v4.0.0 is around `55kB` MINIFIED, `11kB` MINIFIED + GZIPPED, but if you use only some components it will reduce.
  This is an example of Dashboard Layout, built from `create-react-app`. The size of layout is reduced to `39kB`!.

### The why part

I created this because

- It took me a lot of time to initialize dashboard layout when I have
  new projects or ideas to prove and I’m sure that a lot of you are the same as me.
- Sometimes it is hard to refactor because the structure is so poor
  because someone isn’t deeply understand what he/she was doing, as a
  result, rewrite the whole layout which affect other parts of project and you heard your colleague shout "WTF"
  (it actually happened, at least in my experience).
- Because we need to be fast to let others continue our work, we
  frequently write poor and a lot of code. However, we say we don’t
  have time to fix them. Eventually, spend all day paying technical
  debts.

### Objectives

It must be easy enough to use, however still be able to adjust to be compatible
with real word examples and usages. More importantly, it need to follow [Material specs](https://material.io/design/components/navigation-drawer.html#)
since we are 100% based on Material-UI. Last but not least, responsive is a must.
